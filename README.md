# Graph Neural Network for Traffic Volume Kriging
**[Update] Our paper has been accepted for publication in Transportation Research Part C, and the model implementations will be open-sourced soon!**

📝
> This is the code repository for our publication "Towards better traffic volume estimation: Jointly addressing the underdetermination and nonequilibrium problems with correlation-adaptive GNNs" that is published on Transportation Research Part C.
